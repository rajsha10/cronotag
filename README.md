## 🚀 Why crono Tag?

Imagine a brilliant scientist—Dr. Aarya Sen—working late into the night on a cancer-curing compound. She’s made a breakthrough that could save millions. But in the chaos of academia and the noise of social platforms, her research risks being lost, stolen, or miscredited. Months later, a pharma company publishes similar findings. Dr. Sen had the idea first—but how can she prove it?

**Enter crono Tag.**  
crono Tag ensures your innovation is forever time-stamped, verifiable, and attributed to you.
